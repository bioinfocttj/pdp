		"choose a picking alorithm;\n"+
		"1) Click on the button \"Preview\" to have an idea of the picking results;\n"+
		"2) Click on the button \"Apply\" to definitively apply modifications to the image;\n"+
		"3) Click on the button \"Show Results\" to see the table which contains the coordinates\n"+
		"    and slices of the selected particles;\n"+
		"\n"+/*
		"A part of parameters are common for each algorithm (noise tolerance, crop width) \n"+
		"the noise tolerance able to increase the selection precision \n"+
		""+*/
		"All algorithms have common parameters like noise tolerance for the precision of \n" +
		"the particles selection and the square width if you choose to use the crop option. \n"+
		"The debug mode allows the user to see some information message if they're implemented. \n" +
		"The crop mode returns a stack with the selected particles. \n" +
		"\n"+
		"DoG Algorithm : \n"+
		"   This algorithm needs unprocessed stack/dm3 image to do the particles selection. \n" +
		"   Equalization or normalisation are not supported by this algorithm. \n"+
		"   Parameters are sigmas values (for the filters).\n" +
		"   Sigma1 must be greater than Sigma2 \n" +
		"\n"+
		"Dilate Difference Algorithm : \n"+
		"   This algorithm needs unprocessed stack or image. \n" +
		"   Parameters are dilate iterations (for dilation cycles). \n" +
		"   Dilate iteration image1 must be less than Dilate iteration image2. \n" +
		"\n"+
		"Image Correlation Algorithm : \n"+
		"   This algorithm needs a processed stack or image (for our trials we used three median filters (radius 2), \n"+
		//"	 choose radius 2 and apply it twice)) \n" +
		"   Parameters are the differents radius of circles and the radius incrementation for the correlation. \n " +
